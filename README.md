 # Python script to create .docx files from a text with html-like notations.
 
 Unfortunately this script was written in Turkish.
 
 Just like the <> tags in html, this program uses %% tags. Everythin you put in between %BA% tags, will be written as a title in the document.
 
 
 > %BA% for Title 
 >* %BA% Title %BA%
 
 
 > %LN% for numbered lists 
 >* %LN% First Element %LN%
 
 And so on.
